# Real Time Mask Detection and Face Recognition Attendance System
## Real time attendance recognized members entrance (in) and exit (out) with additional first detection person wearing mask or not


### Folders:
members - members save collected images  
xml - cascade xml file  
attendancein - csv list for attendance entry (in)  
attendanceout - csv list for attendance exit (out)
